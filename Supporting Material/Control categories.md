## 1. Control Categories Overview

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

1. **Administrative/Managerial Controls**  
   - Address the human component of cybersecurity  
   - Include policies and procedures defining how data is managed and employee responsibilities  
   - Enforcement may require technical or physical controls  

2. **Technical Controls**  
   - Solutions such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus, encryption, etc.  
   - Used to meet organizational goals and protect assets  

3. **Physical/Operational Controls**  
   - Examples: door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers  
   - Limit physical access to assets by unauthorized personnel

## 2. Control Types

Control types include:

- **Preventative:** Prevent an incident from occurring  
- **Corrective:** Restore an asset after an incident  
- **Detective:** Determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress  
- **Deterrent:** Discourage attacks  

These controls work together to provide **defense in depth**.
